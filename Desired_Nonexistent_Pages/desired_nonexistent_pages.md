# Desired Nonexistent Pages

This is a manually-maintained list of pages that have been linked from elsewhere, or that it would be nice to have, but do not exist yet. Feel free to edit with your own wishes! Also look **below** for a list of pages that exist but only have one language, and so could use some expanding.

**A page does not have to be listed here for you to add it!** These are just the things that we *thought of*. There's certainly plenty more in the world of statistical techniques to be added.

If you create one of these pages, please remove it from this list.

## Data Manipulation

# Missing data
* Stata: mi, R: mice, Amelia, glimp (add the book by Little and Rubin and discuss the three missing data mechanisms)

## Geo-Spatial

* Handling Raster Data
* Handling Vector Data
* Spatial Moving Average Model

## Model Estimation

### OLS

* MANOVA

### GLS

* Nonlinear Instrumental Variables Estimation
* Fixed effects in Generalized Linear Models
* Nonparametric regression
* Conditional Logit
* Endogenous Switching Model
* Nonparametric Sample Selection Models
* Treatment Effect Model

### Multilevel Models

* Hierarchical Bayes Conditional Logit
* Multilevel Regression with Poststratification
* Nonlinear Mixed Effects Models

### Matching

* Nearest-Neighbor Distance Matching
* Coarsened Exact Matching

### Research Design

* Differences in Differences with treatment rollout (use updated methods!)
* Event Study Estimation

### Statistical Inference

* Nonlinear hypothesis tests

#### Nonstandard Errors

* Cluster Bootstrap Standard Errors
* Jackknife Standard Errors
* Non-Standard Bootstrap Standard Errors (bootstrap standard errors that aren't built in to the command and must be done "by hand", i.e. for matching)

## Machine Learning

* A-B Testing
* Artificial Neural Networks

## Presentation

### Figures
* Treatment variation window (panelview package for Stata and R)

## Time Series

* Stationarity and Weak Dependence
* Kalman Filtering/Smoothing
* ARIMAX Model
* TARCH Model
* Recursive Regressions
* State Dependent Regression
* Structural Break (Chow Test)
* Dynamic Panel
* Ex-Post Forecasting
* Ex-Ante Forecasting

## Other

* Import a Fixed-Width Data File
* Export Data to a Foreign Format
* Power Analysis of Interaction Terms
* How to create an ado package
* How to create an R package

# List of One-Language Pages

This is a list of pages that exist but only have an example in one language, and so are ripe for expanding. Easy contributions, too, since the outline of the page is already written, and you can (should) use the same data as in the example already provided.
